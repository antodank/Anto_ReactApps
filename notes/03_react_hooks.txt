React Hooks

useState()
It is used to manage local state in function components.

The useState hook accepts two argument
the first variable is the actual state 
the second variable is a function to update the state by providing a new state.

[state_var,statefunc] = useState(value for the initial state);

first value is the current state
second value is called as state update function. 
Every time this function is called, React re-renders the component to render the recent state.
