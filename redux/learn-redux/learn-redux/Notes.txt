>>> npm install redux react-redux

>>> import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

>>> Create a Reducer
 A reducer is a pure function that accepts 2 parameters: state and action. 
 State can be anything, including objects. Action is an object with type property that specifies the type of action as a string.

>>> Create a Redux Store
The store holds the state as one big global object known as a state tree. The store allows us to:
- 'dispatch' actions to modify the state
- 'subscribe' to recieve notification about state changes
- 'retrieve' the entire state tree


>>>  Now we will connect redux to react. For that wrap the Main App Component with Provider
